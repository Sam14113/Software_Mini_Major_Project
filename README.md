# Software_Mini_Major_Project
 
This project was a component of my internal assessment for HSC Software Design and Development

It was developed as a first prototype for a messaging application, and allowed me to research and gain experience in logic, security, encryption, version control and networking - some of which became evident in the program.

More than anything, it was a positive learning experience about the importance of procedure and organisation in software development. Although I had been deliberate in my planning stages of the project, it was clear that it was simply insufficient for a project of this scale, especially when I didn't have the relevant expertise in certain areas. Further, while I was purposeful in my organisation of code and documentation, it became clear that even more care would need to be taken in this organisation to circumvent problems in the future.
